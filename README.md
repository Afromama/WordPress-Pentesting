#Project 7 - WordPress Pentesting

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

> Objective: Find, analyze, recreate, and document **five vulnerabilities** affecting an old version of WordPress

## Pentesting Report

### 1. Comment Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: Filtering and changing the comment value in the inspect element and adding a script can result posting malicious comments via XSS 
    - Vulnerability types: XSS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.23
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: https://github.com/Afromama/WordPress-Pentesting/blob/main/Walkthrough1.gif
  
  - [ ] Steps to recreate:
    - Post a comment and inspect the post comment element
    - Filter the comment value and inject your comment
    
  - [ ] Affected source code: https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/0292de60ec78c5a44956765189403654fe4d080b

    ### 2. Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  - [ ] Summary: A comment longer than the SQL "text" field that stores it can lead to truncation and malformed HTML, opening up opportunities for XSS.
    - Vulnerability types: XSS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1 
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: https://github.com/Afromama/WordPress-Pentesting/blob/main/Walkthrough2.gif
  - [ ] Steps to recreate:
    - Create an "" tag longer than 64k in a comment, which upon truncation renders as malformed HTML
    - Browsers try to fix this which leads to interpretation of the onmouseover exploit
  - [ ] Affected source code: This is an SQL field size limitation that causes this exploit to work due to truncation

### 3. Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: Payload was injected into the URL and the resulting code lead to an alert popping up everytime the page loads. The browser was tricked into executing the malicious script in this XSS
    - Vulnerability types:
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.6
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
    - Inject a payload into the URL and execute it
    - Example of payload injected: https://wpdistillery.vm/<svg onload=alert(2)>
  - [ ] Affected source code: https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/7ab65139c6838910426567849c7abed723932b87
